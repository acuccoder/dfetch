# dfetch
a tiny system information fetching tool written in sh
(i am allergic to uppercase letters in descriptions)

This is heavily based on [ufetch](https://gitlab.com/jschx/ufetch), but ufetch is on GitLab, and there's no way to fork from GitLab to GitHub.

### DISCLAIMER
This only fully works for Arch Linux, but OS detection should work for most *nixes. Windows sucks.
Currently only the Arch Linux logo is available. Also, package detection doesn't work for anything other than Arch. Support will be added shortly.
